## Hi 🙋🏻‍♀️

- 👋 My name is Yuliia. I am 24 years old. I am from Kyiv. I graduated from Lublin University of Technology with a degree in architecture.

    I started my career as a BIM assistant. Me and my colleagues were creating different kind of scripts and algorithms, which were used for automatization.

    Then I moved to junior developer position. Our team created a hr db. Based on this data, we created different reports, visual representation and internal website.
- 💞️ I was passioned about creating the front end part of the website, so I decided to deep down in it. I finished Udemy courses, and now I am looking for a job, as a junior front end developer to gain an experience and grow up as a specialist.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Redux and related libraries. Also I am learning Wordpress CMS and deepening my knowledge of Native JS, HTML, CSS and React.js

## My hobbies

👀 I’m interested in playing games (simulators, racing, PvP) and reading books. My favourite authors are George Orwell, Oliver Sacks and Adam Kay.
